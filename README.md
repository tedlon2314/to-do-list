# to-do-list
A to-do list using js to store locally and keep your list available if you need to return later.
Color pallete could have been better. If redo I will change colors for easier reading ans writing.
Phase two: adjust to make 'done' items stay present but use a strike through to show user what they have already done so they dont forget if they completed the task or not.
